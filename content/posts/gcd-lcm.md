## Greatest Common Divisor

GCD
: The largest number `n ∈ Z+` that is a factor of both nonzero `x` & `y` such that both `n | x` & `n | y` are true.

Relatively Prime
: Two numbers `x` and `y` are said to be **relatively prime** if and only if their GCD is 1. In other terms: `∄ n ∈ Z+ > 1` where both `n | x` and `n | y` are true.

## Least Common Multiple

LCM
: The smallest number `n ∈ Z+` that is a multiple of both nonzero `x` & `y` such that both `x | n` & `y | n` are true.

## GCD & LCM Prime Factorizations

Let `x,y ∈ Z+` with prime factorizations that can be expressed using a common set of primes:

```
x = P1^α1 * P2^α2 * P3^α3...+ Pr^αr
y = P1^β1 + P2^β2 + P3^β3...+ Pr^βr
```

Then:

```
x divides y if and only if αi≤βi for all 1 <=i<=r
GCD = P1^min(α1,β1) * P2^min(α2,β2) * P3^min(α3,β3)...+ Pr^min(αr,βr)
LCM = P1^max(α1,β1) * P2^max(α2,β2) * P3^max(α3,β3)...+ Pr^max(αr,βr)
```

#### Example:

```
8 = 2^3 * 3^0
6 = 2^1 * 3^1
GCD(8,6) = 2^min(3,1) * 3^min(0,1) = 2^1 * 3^0 = 2
LCM(8,6) = 2^max(3,1) * 3^max(0,1) = 2^3 * 3^1 = 24
```
