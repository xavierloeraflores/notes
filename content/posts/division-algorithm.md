## Integer Division
Integer division is a division operation that falls under __number theory__, a branch of math that is concerned with studying the properties of integers. In integer division, both the inputs and the output are integers resulting in being able to find an integer quotient and an integer remainder given two other integers.

### Divides
For 2 integers `x` and `y`, if there is an integer `k` such that `y=kx`, then `x` divides, `y` is a multiple of `x`, `x` is a factor/divisor of `y`. 

This is denoted by the following notation:
```
x | y
```



#### Dividing Linear Combinations
For x, y, & z being integers: If `x | y` & `x | z`, then `x | (sy + tz)` for any integers `s` & `t`.


### Integer Division Definitions
To find the quotient of two integers, `n` & `d` use the following formula:
```
q = n div d 
q = n / d
```

To find the remainder of two integers, `n` & `d` use the following formula:
```
r = n mod d
r = n % d
```


## The Division Algorithm
For any two given two integers, there is a unique integer quotient and integer remainder that satisfies the following definition:

> Let `n` be an integer and let `d` be a positive integer. Then, there are unique integers `q` and `r`, with `0 ≤ r ≤ d - 1`, such that `n = qd + r`.


### Procedural Version of the Division Algorithm
The following is psuedocode for the division algorithm for an integer `n` that is positive. 

```
# Input: Integers n and d > 0.
# Output: q = n div d, and r = n mod d.
q := 0
r := n
while ( r ≥ d )
      q := q + 1
      r := r - d
end-while
```

### The Division Algorithm with Negative Numbers
When trying to find the quotient and remainder of a negative number, the quotient and remainder will result in different constant values than if the number was positive.

#### Example:
```
44 / 5 = 8
44 % 5 = 4

44 = 8 * 5 + 4
--------------
-44 / 5 = -9
-44 % 5 = 1

-44 = -9 * 5 + 1

```
