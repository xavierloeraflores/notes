Multiplicative Inverse Modulo
: The multiplicative inverse of `x mod y` is a number `n ∈ Z+` such that `x * n mod y = 1`

## Finding the Multiplicative Inverse Modulo:

Given `x` & `y`, to find the multiplicative inverse, `n` of `x mod y` you must find:
`x * n mod y = 1`
or
`x*n ≡ 1 (mod y)`

Substitute values of n to find congruence:

```
x * A1 ≡ B1 !≡ 1 (mod 33)
x * A2 ≡ B2 !≡ 1 (mod 33)
x * A3 ≡ B3 !≡ 1 (mod 33)
x * A4 ≡ B4 ≡ 1 (mod 33) ✅
n = A4 is the multiplicative inverse
```

#### Example:

```
Find the multiplicative inverse of `13 mod 33`
From the following set of numbers:
{2, 10, 18, 26, 4, 12, 20, 28}


13 * 2 ≡ 26 !≡ 1 (mod 33)
13 * 10 ≡ 130 !≡ 1 (mod 33)
13 * 28 ≡ 364 ≡ 1 (mod 33) ✅
```
