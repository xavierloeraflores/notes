# Notes to think about while brainstorming a capstone project

## Forms:

For Task 1, here are the forms to complete:

Capstone Release Form (with authorization to use restricted information, if applicable) the waiver form is only required if your project is based on or includes restricted information
Capstone Topic Approval Form

---

## Choosing a Topic

The approval form ensures you start in the right direction before investing time and effort into Task 2, and it should include the following:

1. An application of machine learning (ML)

2. An organizational need for your ML application to help solve

3. A basic outline of your implementation plan

The "organizational need" requirement gives your project a purpose and an audience.

---

## Machine Learning Algorithms

Need help determining which algorithm will work best? That is understandable! You will not know which algorithm will work best until you have spent time investigating and experimenting. For now, you only need to identify the type: supervised, unsupervised, or reinforced.

---

## Topic Approval

Once you decide on a topic, complete the approval form and email it to your assigned instructor for approval. Preserve the template's section titles and order, and submit all four parts as a single document. Practice professional communication:

Use your WGU email.
Provide a subject, your capstone course number, and your program mentor’s name.
Clearly state your questions or requests.
All elements (Analysis, Design and Development, Implementation and Evaluation) of the Topic Approval Form must be completed.

You must identify a machine learning application in either the descriptive or nondescriptive section. Most often, the nondescriptive method uses ML (e.g., a classification model allowing the user to provide input to an app that returns a prediction).

---

## Non-Descriptive Methods

Nondescriptive method is anything that infers from the data (e.g., making predictions, making recommendations, identifying correlations, inferring from correlations).

Descriptive and nondescriptive methods do not need to be explicitly identified in Task 2. The visualizations and requirements of the user application will satisfy these parts, respectively. The distinction is only made in the approval form to easily identify where and how ML will be applied

---

## Descriptive Methods

Descriptive method means anything that describes the data. Histograms, scatterplots, pie charts—all the familiar descriptive statistics techniques are included. ML methods such as k-means clustering can also be descriptive. Whether a method is descriptive or nondescriptive is determined by its use. For example, using a regression line to describe the relationship between variables is descriptive, but using the line to predict a variable or claim that a correlation exists between the variables is inferential (nondescriptive).

Descriptive and nondescriptive methods do not need to be explicitly identified in Task 2. The visualizations and requirements of the user application will satisfy these parts, respectively. The distinction is only made in the approval form to easily identify where and how ML will be applied.

# FAQS

#### Do I need to make an appointment to get approval?

No. Usually, students email the approval form to their assigned instructor. Instructors will either sign and return a PDF for you to submit or will follow up with questions. However, if you have questions about the requirements or need help choosing a topic, you are encouraged to make an appointment. A 15–30-minute phone call can address most questions or concerns. For technical coding questions, the WGU programming center will be the best point of contact.

#### What if I start working on Task 2 and want to change things? Do I need to resubmit Task 1?

No, not unless it is an entirely different topic. Minor changes from Task 1 to Task 2 are expected and allowed without updating the approval form.

#### Can I use projects from other WGU courses?

You can use any of your work or academic projects (at WGU or elsewhere), provided no proprietary information is used without permission. Do not worry about self-plagiarism; the similarity check will identify and ignore it.

#### Can I use my work from other courses? Should I use it?

You can reuse your own academic or professional work. If reusing your own work is convenient, feel free to do it. But at best, the time saved is little.

#### Do I need an electronic signature as specified in the official rubric?

No, you can type in your name, use a fancy font, or insert an image of your signature.

#### What are the common reasons for Task 1 being returned?

No instructor signature on the approval form before submitting it.
Both or neither box is marked on the waiver form; mark only one box.
Note that the waiver form is only required if your project is based on or includes restricted information.
How many attempts are allowed for each task?

You have unlimited attempts for both Tasks 1 and 2. However, incomplete submissions or submissions significantly falling short of the minimum requirements may be locked from further submissions without instructor approval.

#### Can I use libraries outside the standard (Python, Java, etc.) installation?

Yes, you are allowed and encouraged to use outside libraries. All the major languages, but particularly Python, have a wide array of highly developed ML tools. The capstone is about applying these tools, not their development.

#### What language, libraries, and platforms should I use?

You can use whatever you like. However, it is recommended that you use Python and the scikit-learn (aka sklearn) library, which has an extensive collection of ML-specific tools and tutorials. Jupyter Notebook is a great place to start for the app front end. Passing applications are often submitted as the Notebook file (.ipynb) and data files. Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to present code and information together, but they can also progressively be developed into a more polished product. Students are often tempted to use Java because of their JavaFX experience in software, but a GUI is not required, and Python is better suited, overall, for everything that is required.

A development path might look like the following:

Python IDE → Jupyter Notebook → notebook with widgets → hosted notebook with widgets → web app.

#### What sort of user interface do I need? Do I need a GUI?

No, a GUI is not required. Your app must be usable by the "client" to solve the proposed problem. If the evaluators can run your app as intended, playing the role of the "client", following your user guide, then your app will be considered to have a user-friendly interface. This can be done through a GUI and widgets, but using the command line or reading user data from a local directory will also suffice.

#### I only have a Linux (or Mac) machine. Will evaluators be able to run my code?

To avoid challenges with non-Windows apps (Linux, Android, Mac), you should provide explicit instructions in the user guide for a Windows user to run your code, such as using a virtual machine, a remote machine, or a Linux subsystem.
