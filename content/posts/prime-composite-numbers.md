#### Prime & Composite Relationship:
If `p ∈ Z+` and `p > 1`, then `p` is either **prime** or **composite**. 

#### Prime Numbers:
If `p ∈ Z+` and `p > 1`, then `p` is **prime** if the the only factors of p are `1` & `p`.

#### Composite Numbers:
If `p ∈ Z+` and `p > 1`, then `p` is **composite** if `p` if `∃ a ∈ Z+` such that `a | p` & `1 < a < p`. 


## Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every integer `a ∈ Z+` and `a > 1` is either prime or can be expressed as a unique product of 2 or more primes (*composite*), where the primes are written in non-decreasing order. 
Examples: 
- `12 = 2 * 2 * 3 = 2^2 * 3`
- `200 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 = 2^3 * 5^2`

## Trial Division Theorem
If `n ∈ Z+` and `n > 1`, then `n` is prime if and only if `n` is not divisible by any prime `p` such that `p ≤ √n`.

If `n ∈ Z+`, `n > 1` and `n` is composite, the `n` has a prime divisor `p` such that `p ≤ √n`.

If then `n = ab`, where `a ∈ Z+` such that `1<a<n` and where `b ∈ Z+` such that `1<b`. Then `a` and `b` are factors of `n` and `a ≤ √n` and `b ≤ √n` because if both `a` or `b` are larger than `√n`, then `ab > √n * √n = n` which is a contradiction.

For any positive composite integer `n`, one of the factors has to be less than or equal to `√n` because if two factors are greater than `√n`, then the product would be greater than `n`. 
## Other Prime Number Properties
#### Euclid's Theorem
There are infinitely many prime numbers.

Assuming we have the complete set of all primes:
`P1,P2,P3,...,Pn`. We create a composite number that is the product of all the primes in the set:
`Q = P1 * P2 * P3 * .... * Pn`.If we add `1` to the composite number:
`Q + 1= P1 * P2 * P3 * .... * Pn + 1`, then `Q+1` is either composite or prime. 

Assuming this new number is not prime, then the number is composite meaning it should be divisible by some prime `P < Q+1`. Since it can't be divided by our presumed completed list of primes, then it must be prime which means there must be a prime that is not in the list. 

Therefore, there are infinitely many primes.

#### Prime Number Total Approximation:
The number of primes less than or equal to `x` is approximately `x / ln(x)`.
