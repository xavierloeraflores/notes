### Discrete Math Symbols:

| Symbol  | Meaning           | Usage       | Example         | Reads as                     |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ∃       | There exists      | `∃`         | `∃x`            | There exists `x`             |
| ∈       | Element of        | `x ∈ S`     | `x ∈ {1, 2, 3}` | `x` is an element of `S`     |
| ∉       | Not an element of | `x ∉ S`     | `x ∉ {1, 2, 3}` | `x` is not an element of `S` |
| &#8739; | Divides           | x &#8739; y | 3 &#8739; 9     | `3` divides `9`              |
| Z       | Integers          | Z           | Z+              | Set of positive integers     |
| ≡       | Congruent         | `x ≡ y`     | `0 ≡ 10%5`      | 0 is congruent to 10 mod 5   |
